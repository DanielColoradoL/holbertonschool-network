OSI Model and Networking Basics
OSI Model
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven distinct layers. These layers facilitate communication between different systems by providing a structured approach to data transmission.

What it is: A conceptual model that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system.
How many layers it has: Seven layers.
How it is organized: It is organized into seven layers, each responsible for specific tasks related to data transmission.
LAN (Local Area Network)
What is a LAN: A LAN is a network that connects computers and devices within a limited geographical area, such as a home, office, or school.
Typical usage: LANs are commonly used for sharing resources like files, printers, and internet connections among multiple devices.
Typical geographical size: Usually covers a small area, such as a single building or a group of nearby buildings.
WAN (Wide Area Network)
What is a WAN: A WAN is a network that spans a large geographical area, connecting multiple LANs and other networks together.
Typical usage: WANs are used to connect remote locations or offices over long distances, often utilizing leased lines or public networks.
Typical geographical size: Spans across cities, countries, or even continents.
Internet
What is the Internet: The Internet is a global network that connects millions of computers and devices worldwide, enabling communication and information sharing.
What is an IP address: An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.
What are the 2 types of IP address: IPv4 and IPv6.
What is localhost: A reserved IP address often used to refer to the local computer or device, typically represented as 127.0.0.1 for IPv4.
What is a subnet: A subdivision of an IP network that allows for efficient management of IP addresses within a network.
IPv6
Why IPv6 was created: IPv6 was created to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses and to provide additional features and enhancements over IPv4.
TCP/UDP
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol): These are the two main protocols used for data transfer at the transfer layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model.
Main difference between TCP and UDP: TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication with error checking and retransmission mechanisms, while UDP offers simpler, connectionless communication without guaranteed delivery.
Port Numbers
SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS port numbers:
SSH: 22
HTTP: 80
HTTPS: 443
Network Connectivity Check
Tool/protocol often used to check if a device is connected to a network: ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) Ping is commonly used for network connectivity checks.
